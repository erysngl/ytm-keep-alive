A lightweight, pure DOM bookmarklet to prevent YouTube and YouTube Music from pausing with the *"Video paused. Continue watching?"* prompt.

## ✨ Features
* **No Extensions Required:** Keeps your browser fast and clean.
* **100% Safe (TrustedHTML Bypass):** Built entirely with pure DOM elements (`document.createElement`). It does not use `innerHTML`, completely bypassing YouTube's strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
* **Draggable UI:** Features a sleek, dark-themed floating timer that you can drag anywhere on the screen.
* **Smart Detection:** Clicks the "Yes" confirmation button automatically within seconds of it appearing.

## 🚀 Easy Installation
You don't need to copy or paste any code. 

1. Go to the **[Installation Page](https://erysngl.github.io/ytm-keep-alive/)**
2. Drag and drop the red **"Drag to Bookmarks"** button to your browser's bookmarks bar.
3. Open YouTube Music, click the bookmark, and enjoy uninterrupted music!

## 🛠️ How it Works
Once activated, it creates a sleek floating widget. It now scans the DOM **every single second** for the confirmation prompt, ensuring lightning-fast detection. To prevent the browser from suspending the background tab, it bypasses the Page Visibility API and performs a 1-pixel micro-scroll every minute. If the prompt is found, it automatically clicks it, increments the live **"Prevented" counter**, and displays a "Pause Prevented!" notification on the widget.

## 🌐 Browser Support

This bookmarklet uses standard web APIs and pure DOM manipulation, making it fully compatible with all modern desktop browsers:

- ✅ **Google Chrome** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ **Mozilla Firefox**
- ✅ **Microsoft Edge**
- ✅ **Brave Browser**
- ✅ **Opera / Opera GX**
- ✅ **Safari** (macOS)

*Note: Mobile browsers generally do not support a traditional bookmarks bar for bookmarklets, so this tool is designed for desktop use.*

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

The code inside the installation button on the `index.html` page is minified to work effectively as a single-line bookmarklet. 

If you want to read, review, or contribute to the source code, please check the **[`ytm-keep-alive.js`](./ytm-keep-alive.js)** file. It contains the fully formatted, commented, and readable version of the script. 

*Note: All pull requests modifying the core logic should be applied to `ytm-keep-alive.js` first.*
